<!-- Activation block for task-observer, taken from references/environments.md (rebelytics/one-skill-to-rule-them-all, CC-BY-4.0). -->

Before the first tool call of any session — and before writing or
proposing a plan, not merely before executing one — invoke the
task-observer skill AND execute its Session Start Protocol (storage
check, frontmatter scan, review trigger). Loading the skill and running
the protocol are separate steps; a session that loads the file and stops
has activated nothing. Any turn that will involve a tool call counts; do
not classify the session as "too simple" from its opening message.

Select skills on the DECISION the request is about, not on the artefact it
arrived as. Name what the user is deciding, then match the installed skill
descriptions against that — a request handed over as a file to review
still needs the skill whose description names its subject.

After completing each task, list the observation records written this
session in the same turn and report a one-line summary from that listing
(ids and titles, or "none logged and why") — never from memory of
writing them. This is the activation backstop: it forces a look at the log,
so a session that silently skipped the protocol is discovered at the
first task boundary instead of never.

Loading a skill is not complete until you have queried the observation
log for OPEN observations naming it and read their bodies:
  find "/home/user/Skill/task-observer-workspace/skill-observations/observation-log" -maxdepth 1 \
    -name '*.md' -exec grep -l "skill:.*<skill-name>" {} +
(Use find, not a bare *.md glob. Under zsh an unmatched glob is an error,
so on an empty log the command never runs and the enclosing block aborts —
and 2>/dev/null does not help, because the redirection belongs to a
command that never starts. This is the first thing that fires on a fresh
install, in every session, for as long as the log is empty.)
Apply their insights to the current work — meaning: let them change what
you do in THIS task. Editing the skill file, or writing the rule into any
other file a later session reads, is acting on the observation and waits
for the review. See "Log, don't act" in SKILL.md: the test is whether the
action leaves a durable change outside the observation log. Run this at every skill load, however many skills load
in one session. The session-start scan does not cover it: that is a
frontmatter sweep over every observation at session start, this is a
body-level lookup for one skill at the moment its rules are applied.

The converse holds too: the grep, and any checkpoint line recording the
load, run only in the same batch as the Skill invocation, and take the
skill name from a load that has actually happened — never from a list of
skills you built to load. A checkpoint line written without the load is a
false record. Before writing to any file a skill reads at run time (a
state file), load that skill: a state file that describes itself is not a
substitute for the skill that owns it.

The task-observer workspace for this project is:
  /home/user/Skill/task-observer-workspace
Every path the skill uses derives from that root and nothing else:
  /home/user/Skill/task-observer-workspace/skill-observations/observation-log/   (the log)
  /home/user/Skill/task-observer-workspace/skill-observations/cross-cutting-principles.md
  /home/user/Skill/task-observer-workspace/skill-updates/                        (staging root)
  /home/user/Skill/task-observer-workspace/skill-updates/PENDING.md              (staging manifest)
Never resolve any of them from the current working
directory — a cwd inside an ephemeral checkout (a git worktree, a temporary
clone) is torn down and takes the log with it. Never place the workspace
inside a skills-discovery directory or any path linked into one. If this
environment mints a separate project identity per checkout, or more than
one agent works this project, the pinned path above is the single shared
location; do not derive one per session, tool or project.

The user's repositories live under:
  /home/user
(the root the sibling check sweeps before declaring a skill absent;
observation-log.md, "Skill families and the sibling check").

A subagent dispatched by a session that already runs this protocol does
not run it again and does not write to the log. The controller observes,
because only it sees the whole task and its review; a subagent that
notices something worth logging says so in its final report, and the
controller writes it, running the id snippet per write. A start-up rule
in a project file reaches every agent the project ever dispatches.

An observation file comes into being only through
  bash "/home/user/Skill/.claude/skills/task-observer/scripts/new-observation.sh" <slug> "/home/user/Skill/task-observer-workspace"
which prints the path to write into. Never by copying another file's
header or counting a listing — including on the turn after a
compaction, when the skill body is out of context.

Aturan ini berlaku untuk semua sesi di repo ini (detail di `docs/handoff/README.md`).

- Di awal sesi, baca `docs/handoff/INDEX.md` dan buka entri terbaru yang relevan sebelum mulai bekerja.
- Di akhir sesi, atau setelah keputusan penting, tulis entri baru di `docs/handoff/sessions/` memakai `docs/handoff/TEMPLATE.md` (source: claude-code), tambahkan satu baris di bagian atas tabel `INDEX.md`, lalu commit dan push ke branch kerja.
- Catat alasan keputusan dan hal yang ditolak. Jangan simpan rahasia atau data pribadi.
