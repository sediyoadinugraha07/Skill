validate-skill-bundle.py — the pre-delivery gate, as assertions.

Checks a staged skill directory (and optionally its packed .skill bundle)
against the criteria the INSTALLER enforces, not against what seems
sensible. Every check compares a measurement to a bound in the same step:
an unasserted metric manufactures confidence that no defect exists.

Usage
-----
  python3 validate-skill-bundle.py <staged-skill-dir> [--bundle file.skill] [--pack out.skill]
  python3 validate-skill-bundle.py --repo-only <repo-dir>
  python3 validate-skill-bundle.py --selftest   # residue-check fixtures; exit 1 on any mismatch

  --pack        writes a well-formed bundle (POSIX separators on any platform)
                after the directory checks pass, then validates it. An
                unquoted frontmatter `name:` is rewritten to the quoted form
                in the staged SKILL.md first, so the packed copy carries it.
  --repo        additionally check the repo's manifests against the skill.
  --repo-only   check ONLY the repo's manifests, skipping the skill checks.
                Also runs the markdown shape check over the repo-root .md
                files (README, guides): a blank line splitting one list in
                two is reported as a failure with file:line.

Why --repo-only exists: in a repo whose root IS the skill directory
(`SKILL.md` at the top level), the two check sets contradict each other.
The skill checks require the directory name to equal the frontmatter `name`
and forbid a plugin manifest; the repo is named after the repository, not
the skill, and is the one place the manifest belongs. Running the skill
checks over a repo root therefore reports two failures that are both
correct behaviour. Point the skill checks at the staged skill directory and
`--repo-only` at the repo.

Exit status 0 = every check passed; 1 = at least one failed (all failures
are listed, not just the first).

Limits are stated as numbers and labelled with where they come from, so
the check is implementable without guessing and can be updated when the
consumer changes them.

# --- Core-size ratchet -------------------------------------------------------
# The per-session core is loaded in full, every session, by every consumer of
# the skill. It has grown before: a split brought it down and two months of
# ordinary review rounds put it back, because nothing in the loop pushed the
# other way. A guideline that is only prose loses to a hundred individually
# reasonable additions.
#
# CEILING ONLY EVER GOES DOWN. Raising it is not a fix for a failing gate; it
# is the failure. A release that needs more room in the core needs a split
# instead, and the reference files are where the room is. The number below is
# the high-water mark at the release that introduced this check — every later
# release either holds it or lowers it.
#
# TARGET is the size the core is trying to reach. The gap between CEILING and
# TARGET is reported on every run, passing or failing, so the debt stays
# visible rather than being rediscovered by a contributor with a line counter.
# The ceiling is a property of the SKILL, not of this script. It is read from
# the skill under test — `core_max_lines:` in SKILL.md frontmatter, or a
# `.core-ceiling` file beside it holding the number. A skill that declares
# neither has not opted in: the count is reported and nothing is gated. This
# script ships inside task-observer but is run against every skill in a
# library, and a constant that describes one skill must never bound another.
#
# The ceiling also FOLLOWS the core down. A check that only blocks growth
# leaves every trim as open headroom, and the next ordinary additions spend it
# without anyone deciding to. So a declared ceiling more than
# CEILING_SLACK_TOLERANCE lines above the core fails too; the fix is to lower
# the declared number to the current count in the same commit as the trim.
