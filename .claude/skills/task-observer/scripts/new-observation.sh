#!/usr/bin/env bash
# new-observation.sh — derive the next observation id AND create the file,
# as one command that cannot be split.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/new-observation.sh <slug> [workspace-root]
#
#   <slug>            kebab-case, no id prefix, no extension ("short-slug")
#   [workspace-root]  the pinned absolute workspace path — the directory that
#                     holds skill-observations/. Defaults to the environment
#                     variable TASK_OBSERVER_WORKSPACE. One of the two is
#                     required; the log is never resolved from the cwd.
#
# Prints the created file's absolute path on stdout (one line) and exits 0.
# Any guard firing prints its message on stderr and exits 1 with NO file
# created. Write the observation body into the printed path, with the id
# from its NNNN- prefix in the `id:` field — copied, never retyped.
#
# This is the id-derivation snippet from SKILL.md "How to Log", unchanged in
# substance, packaged so that the moment of derivation cannot drift away
# from the moment of writing: an id derived at session start and carried in
# memory to a later write is the collision the snippet's rules forbid, and
# a rule that has failed twice while loaded needs the write path itself to
# enforce it. Where this script can run, it is the only write path.
#
# Steps, in order: archival sweep of stale resolved files (a side effect of
# deriving the id, never a separate duty) → id = max(active prefixes,
# archive prefixes, .id-floor) + 1, the listing guarded against find's
# count before the floor enters → PREFIX collision guard across active and
# archive (two slugs sharing one number is the failure; a path check cannot
# see it) → noclobber create → floor write (after the create, so a run that
# creates nothing never moves it) → print the path.
#
# bash, not sh: the `10#` arithmetic is a bash extension. Runs on bash 3.2
# (stock macOS): case patterns are parenthesised for that reason.
